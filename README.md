## Introduction

The Flower Species Clustering App is designed to help users cluster different species of flowers based on their features. The app leverages machine learning algorithms to perform clustering and provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing the results.

## Features

- **Clustering Algorithms**: Supports various clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Provides interactive charts and graphs to visualize the clustering results.
- **Dataset Management**: Allows users to upload and manage their own datasets.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on both Android and iOS devices.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
